                    to submit a request. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request

                    period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
                    Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the
                    verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply
                    with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability requests, we will provide the responsive
                    information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily usable format that
                    allows you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance. </span></p>

                    the CCPA defines "sale" broadly, and that definition could include information that we have shared
                    with our service providers and certain technology providers. In the past twelve months, we have
                    "sold" (as defined under the CCPA) the categories of personal information set further in the table
                    under 'Processing of Personal Information" above. We "sold" the personal information for the
                    purposes described in this California Statement and the Privacy Statement. Additionally, we do not
                    and will not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16 without
                    affirmative authorization. </span></p>
